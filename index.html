			   Here at Pixie Potions, we specialize in providing our customers with personalized solutions to whatever ails them. 
			   Whether you be afflicted with the winter chill, need to ditch a tricky generational curse, or long to breath underwater with your selkie friend, we've got you covered.
			   <br> <br>
               Founded 3 generations ago, our small family business considers it our honor to serve our community. Apothecaries by trade, we take great care to ensure the quality of our potions. 
			   For directions to our shop: close your eyes, spin counter-clockwise three times in place, and speak your name aloud. From there, follow the sound of bells. You will find your way. 
			   We look forward to meeting with you soon~
