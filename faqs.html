				<h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2>
					<br>
					<p class="justify"> 
						<strong>Where is the storefront located?</strong>
						<br>
						The precise location of our storefront is intentionally left ambiguous for security purposes. However, our shop is charmed in such a way that if you follow these instructions,
						you will be able to find your way to our store: close your eyes, spin counter-clockwise precisely three times in place, and confidently speak your name aloud. 
					</p>
					<p class="padding justify">
						<strong>How much does each potion cost?</strong>
						<br>
						The pricing for our potions is determined on a case-by-case basis. The availability and cost of the ingredients needed to make each elixir, as well as the concentration of active ingredients 
						needed for each individual customer, varies wildly. This unfortunately means that we cannot give definitive pricing for our products. However, our friendly staff are more than happy to accomodate
						the differing needs and financial capabilities of every one of our customers. We can assure you that the cost of our potions has never been an issue before, nor should it be in the future!
					</p>
					<p class="justify"> 
						<strong>Does (xyz) potion have any side effects?</strong>
						<br>
						As every one of our potions is magical, and magic can be unpredictable by nature, we cannot 100% guarantee that none of our potions will have any side effects. However, our customers have yet
						to experience and side effect more serious than temporary and minor blurry vision. Our apothecaries are highly trained and prepared to deal with any unwanted side effects that you may encounter,
						however rare and unlikely an occurence side effects may be. 
					</p>
					<p class="padding justify">
						<strong>Do you sell other magical artifacts?</strong>
						<br>
						We do not! Sorry to disappoint. But, since we are such a highly specialized business, we can focus entirely on providing our community with the highest quality of potions possible. 
					</p>
					<p class="justify"> 
						<strong>What is your refund policy if a potion doesn't work for me?</strong>
						<br>
						Because each of our potions are made to suit each customer on an individual level, the likelihood of one not working is very slim. However, were this to happen, we would be compelled to 
						fulfill our promise and make it up to the customer personally. We desire nothing more than for everybody who enters our shop to have the best experience possible.
